# HotelTourDB-Advanced
Advanced PL/SQL version of the HotelTourDB project, including stored procedures, functions, triggers, and database automation for hotel and tourism management.
# Database Generation System – PL/SQL Project

## Project Overview
This project is an extension of the previous **Hospitality & Tourism Database** project. It focuses on **automating database operations and managing hotel and tourism data** through PL/SQL in Oracle. The system includes procedures, functions, triggers, cursors, and exception handling to facilitate data management and reporting.

---

## Purpose
The main goal of this project is to demonstrate practical use of **PL/SQL features** to manage:

- Users and their information  
- Hotel bookings and reservations  
- Hotel and attraction reviews  
- Restaurants and cleaning services  
- Data validation and automated updates  

It serves as a foundation for developing more complex applications, such as **online reservation systems** or **analytical tools** for improving hotel services.

---

## Features
- **PL/SQL Procedures and Functions:** Encapsulate repeated operations such as adding users, reservations, or checking availability.  
- **Packages:** Organize related procedures and functions for maintainability.  
- **Triggers:** Automate updates and enforce business rules.  
- **Cursors:** Handle both implicit and explicit queries for dynamic data retrieval.  
- **Exception Handling:** Ensure safe and reliable database operations.

## Project Structure
- `README.md` – project description and overview  
- `queries/` – SQL and PL/SQL scripts including procedures, functions, cursors, triggers, and exception handling  
- `ERD/` – Entity-Relationship Diagram illustrating tables, relationships, and constraints

---

## ERD
The included ER diagram illustrates the database structure for the hotel and tourism management system, including:

- Users  
- Hotels  
- Reservations  
- Reviews  
- Restaurants  
- Cleaning services

It provides a clear visual representation of table relationships and key constraints.

---

## Usage
The database is intended for **managing reservations, evaluating performance, and providing insights for hotel and tourism services**. It can also serve as a learning tool for understanding **advanced PL/SQL features** and database automation.
